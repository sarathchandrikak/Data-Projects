# ðŸ§© Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a data ingestion and transformation pipeline that:

-> Ingests raw data automatically from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket into a raw table in BigQuery
-> Performs data transformations and writes the results into a modified (cleaned or modeled) BigQuery table
-> Orchestrates and schedules these steps using Astronomer Airflow DAGs, ensuring reliability and visibility
-> (Optional enhancement) Incorporates a Cloud Run service that is triggered when new files are added to the GCS bucket, enabling near real-time ingestion and transformation

### ðŸ§© Business Use Case

To provide real-time updates on the latest YouTube metrics for user playlists, ensuring accurate and timely visibility into views, likes, and comments.

### ðŸ§© Stages of Pipeline

| Component              | Benefit                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Raw GCS â†’ BQ Table** | Centralizes all raw user event data                 |
| **DataProc Serverless**| Business logic to do transformations and add data transformed data to BQ table    |
| **Airflow DAGs**       | Ensures DAGS run and add data to BQ tables          |
| **Cloud Run Trigger**  | Enables near real-time ingestion for fresh insights |
